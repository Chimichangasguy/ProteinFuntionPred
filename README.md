# ProteinFuntionPred

This competition evaluates participants' predictions of Gene Ontology (GO) terms for protein sequences. The evaluation is performed on a test set of proteins that initially have no assigned functions but may accumulate experimental annotations after the submission deadline. The test set is divided into three subontologies: Molecular Function (MF), Biological Process (BP), and Cellular Component (CC). 
The final performance measure is the arithmetic mean of the maximum F-measures calculated on the three subontologies. 

For the training set, we include all proteins with annotated terms that have been validated by experimental or high-throughput evidence, traceable author statement (evidence code TAS), or inferred by curator (IC). 
The test superset is a set of protein sequences on which the participants are asked to predict GO terms.
